Abstract
Background
Over the past decade, High Income Countries (HICs), such as the United Kingdom, have experienced a decline in vaccine uptake. Notable example is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which acts as a tracer for potential inequities in uptake. Gaining and understand of factors affecting lowered uptake is essential for effective public health policies.
Methods
The current study aimed to gain an understanding of factors affecting MMR vaccine uptake at a GP-level over the 2021-2023 period in the Liverpool City Region. Using publicly available COVER data on MMR uptake for 245 GPs and indicators for general practice performance and characteristics from the National General Practice Profiles a multivariable linear regression model was generated. The model was developed using a stepwise selection process alongside inclusion of variables a priori.
Results
The results show associations of increased MMR vaccine uptake to positive experience of patients to their GP practice, caring responsibility, percentage of Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) points achieved. The model, however, showed a negative relationship to vaccine uptake at the most deprived quintile, in total only explaining between 25-35% of the variation in vaccine uptake.
Conclusion
We conclude that lower uptake is associated with increase in deprivation, with lowest uptake observed in most deprived communities. Increased uptake was associated with practices where patients reported positive experiences showed higher uptake.  While these datasets may be suitable for monitoring purposes, they lack the granularity required to suggest interventions to increase uptake and reduce inequity.
